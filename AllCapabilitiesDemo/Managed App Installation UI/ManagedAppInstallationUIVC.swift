            â€¢ The Managed App Installation UI is designed for organizations that control iPhones or iPads using Mobile Device Management (MDM).

            â€¢ It allows managed apps to display a standard, system-provided interface when installing, updating, or setting up the app.

            â€¢ Users donâ€™t need to manually enter configuration information or make complex decisionsâ€”the system handles this automatically for a smooth experience.

            â€¢ IT administrators can remotely push apps and their settings onto usersâ€™ devices, saving time and minimizing errors.

            â€¢ This capability ensures companies and schools can quickly deploy necessary apps with clear guidance shown by the device itself, rather than requiring users to work through complicated, custom in-app setups.

            â€¢ The feature is especially useful for large deployments, as it streamlines installation and configuration processes for both administrators and end users.

            â€¢ Overall, it simplifies how essential apps are installed and managed on multiple devices within organizations.

            â€¢ Used by enterprise or school apps deployed through MDM systems.

            â€¢ Enabled in the app's Xcode project via an entitlement.

            â€¢ Installation and updates are managed remotely by IT admins.

            â€¢ iOS presents a standard system interface during install/update.

            â€¢ No need for custom installation UI in the app itself.

            â€¢ Common in business or educational apps distributed internally.

            â€¢ MDM handles triggering the installation UI automatically.

            â€¢ Ensures a smooth, consistent deployment experience for users.
