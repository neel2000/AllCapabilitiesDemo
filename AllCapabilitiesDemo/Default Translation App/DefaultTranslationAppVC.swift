            The Default Translation App capability allows third-party translation apps to register themselves with the system so they can become the userâ€™s preferred app for handling translations. This makes it possible for users to choose your app instead of Appleâ€™s built-in Translate app when they translate text across iOS.

            ðŸ”¹ What It Does

                â€¢ System Integration â€“ Lets your app act as the default translation app for text, similar to how users can pick a default browser or mail app.

                â€¢ Quick Access â€“ When a user highlights text and selects Translate from the menu, iOS can open your app instead of Apple Translate.

                â€¢ Consistency â€“ Ensures all translation requests across the system go through the app the user prefers.

                â€¢ Developer Control â€“ Your app can offer additional features (offline models, custom dictionaries, domain-specific translations) while still feeling native.

            ðŸ”‘ Why Itâ€™s Useful

                â€¢ Creates a seamless experience for users who rely on translation.

                â€¢ Helps third-party apps compete with Appleâ€™s Translate app by becoming the default choice.

                â€¢ Supports specialized translation apps (e.g., medical, legal, or business-focused apps).

            ðŸ“Œ Requirements

                â€¢ Apple Developer Program membership.

                â€¢ Enable Default Translation App capability in Xcode.

                â€¢ Implement translation services in your app (using Appleâ€™s Translation framework or a custom translation engine).

                â€¢ The feature depends on Apple exposing UI in Settings to let users choose the default translation app (currently limited and not widely available).
                        
                â€¢ Required iOS 18.4 or later
