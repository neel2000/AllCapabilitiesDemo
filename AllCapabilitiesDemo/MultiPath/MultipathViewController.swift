        The Multipath capability allows your app to maintain network connections across multiple interfaces (like Wi-Fi and cellular) at the same time, improving reliability and performance.

        üîë Key Features

            ‚Ä¢ Use both Wi-Fi and cellular data seamlessly.

            ‚Ä¢ Automatically switch between networks without interrupting the connection.

            ‚Ä¢ Improves stability for long-lived connections like VoIP, video calls, or streaming.

            ‚Ä¢ Built on Apple‚Äôs Multipath TCP (MPTCP) technology.

        üìå Common Use Cases

            ‚Ä¢ VoIP apps: Maintain calls when switching from Wi-Fi to cellular.

            ‚Ä¢ Video conferencing: Prevent interruptions if Wi-Fi drops.

            ‚Ä¢ Streaming apps: Keep media playing smoothly during network changes.

            ‚Ä¢ Enterprise apps: Ensure persistent VPN sessions.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

            ‚Ä¢ Requires the Multipath entitlement from Apple (not enabled for all apps).

            ‚Ä¢ Apple grants access mainly to apps where reliability is critical (e.g., VoIP, enterprise, conferencing).

            ‚Ä¢ Can slightly increase battery and data usage since multiple interfaces may be active.

            ‚Ä¢ Must use the Network framework or NSURLSessionConfiguration.multipathServiceType to enable.

        enum MultipathServiceType
        
        case none
            The default service type indicating that Multipath TCP should not be used.
        
        case handover
             A Multipath TCP service that provides seamless handover between Wi-Fi and cellular in order to preserve the connection.
        
        case interactive
             A service whereby Multipath TCP attempts to use the lowest-latency interface.
        
        case aggregate
              A service that aggregates the capacities of other Multipath options in an attempt to increase throughput and minimize latency.
