            The Head Pose capability lets your app access the position and orientation of the user‚Äôs head in 3D space. It uses the ARKit framework and TrueDepth camera (on supported devices) to provide real-time tracking.
            
            üîë Key Features
            
                ‚Ä¢ Tracks the rotation and movement of the user‚Äôs head.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Provides pitch, yaw, and roll values in real time.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Works with ARKit face tracking for precise motion capture.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Can be combined with gaze tracking or facial expressions for richer interactions.
            
            üìå Common Use Cases
            
                ‚Ä¢ Accessibility: Control the interface with head movements.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Gaming/AR apps: Move the camera or trigger actions based on head direction.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Health & fitness apps: Measure posture, alignment, or neck movements.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Entertainment: Enable immersive experiences like nodding to confirm actions.
            
            ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
            
                ‚Ä¢ Requires a device with a TrueDepth camera (e.g., Face ID-enabled iPhones/iPads).
            
                ‚Ä¢ Needs the Head Pose entitlement in Xcode.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Must request camera access permission from the user.
            
                ‚Ä¢ Respect user privacy ‚Äî only use tracking for the stated purpose.
            
            
            üéØ Pitch, Yaw, and Roll

            1. Pitch ‚Äì Up and down movement of the head.

                ‚Ä¢ Like nodding ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

                ‚Ä¢ Example: Looking up at the ceiling or down at the floor.

            2. Yaw ‚Äì Left and right movement of the head.

                ‚Ä¢ Like shaking your head ‚Äúno‚Äù.

                ‚Ä¢ Example: Turning to look over your left or right shoulder.

            3. Roll ‚Äì Tilting your head sideways.

                ‚Ä¢ Like leaning your ear toward your shoulder.

                ‚Ä¢ Example: Tilting your head to the left/right while thinking.

            üìå In ARKit, these values are provided in radians (or degrees if you convert them).
            They let developers know exactly where the user‚Äôs head is pointing in 3D space in real time.
