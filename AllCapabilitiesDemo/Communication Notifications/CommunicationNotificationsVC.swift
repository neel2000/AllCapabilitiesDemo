            The Communication Notifications capability in iOS helps apps deliver notifications for calls and messages that feel just like the iPhone‚Äôs built-in Phone or Messages app. This makes communication apps (like WhatsApp, Zoom, or custom call/messaging apps) feel seamless and natural to users.

            ‚ú® What Is the Communication Notifications Capability?

            Imagine you‚Äôre building an app that lets people make voice or video calls or send messages. When someone calls or messages a user, you want the notification to feel like a real phone call or text.

            With this capability, your app can:

                ‚Ä¢ Show notifications that look like incoming calls or messages, including caller name and preview text.

                ‚Ä¢ Add interactive buttons like ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù, ‚ÄúDecline‚Äù, or ‚ÄúReply‚Äù.

                ‚Ä¢ Use Apple‚Äôs system to display a full-screen call interface (just like the Phone app).

                ‚Ä¢ Integrate with Siri, so users can use voice commands like ‚ÄúAnswer the call.‚Äù

                ‚Ä¢ Deliver urgent, time-sensitive alerts, even if the phone is locked or in Do Not Disturb mode.

            üîë What Does It Do?
            1. Show Call-Like Notifications

                ‚Ä¢ Incoming calls through your app appear like iPhone calls.

                ‚Ä¢ Example: ‚Äúüìû Incoming Call: John Doe (Video Call)‚Äù with Accept/Decline options.

            2. Add Interactive Buttons

                ‚Ä¢ Notifications can include quick-action buttons.

                ‚Ä¢ Example:

                    ‚Ä¢ Accept ‚Üí starts the call.

                    ‚Ä¢ Decline ‚Üí dismisses the call.

                    ‚Ä¢ Reply ‚Üí sends a quick message response.

            3. Work with the iPhone‚Äôs Call System

                    ‚Ä¢ Uses CallKit, so your app‚Äôs calls feel like normal phone calls.

                    ‚Ä¢ Supports the full-screen call UI instead of just a banner.

                    ‚Ä¢ Great for apps like Skype, WhatsApp, or FaceTime alternatives.

            4. Support Siri Integration

                ‚Ä¢ Users can interact with your app using Siri.

                ‚Ä¢ Example:

                    ‚Ä¢ ‚Äúüì± Call John on MyApp.‚Äù

                    ‚Ä¢ ‚Äúüó£ Answer the call.‚Äù

            5. Deliver High-Priority Notifications

                ‚Ä¢ Notifications show up even when the phone is locked.

                ‚Ä¢ Can override Do Not Disturb for urgent calls/messages.

                ‚Ä¢ May include a ringtone-like sound to grab attention.

            ‚úÖ In short: Communication Notifications make third-party communication apps feel like native phone and messaging apps, providing users with a smooth, professional, and reliable experience.
